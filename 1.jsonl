He’ll do it for any line — but that one. “I’m happy to do it, but when they say, ‘Can you say that?’ I can’t,” he said.\n\nCarell’s character would often say the line after an innocent comment was made that could be interpreted with a sexual meaning.\n\nAs for whether “that’s what she said” lives on for the cast? Carell said he never repeats the line in his personal life. Fischer, who played Pam Beesly in the show, said she does “throw them out” now and again.\n\nThe beloved NBC series, which aired from 2005 to 2013, was known for its documentary-style filming, with actors often breaking the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera during a scene. This habit, for the “Morning Show” star, was difficult to stop in his next projects.\n\n“I have never had a job where I didn’t look into the camera at some point,” he said.\n\nHe pointed to his Oscar-nominated role as John du Pont in “Foxcatcher” as an instant when he probably slipped and went back to his Michael Scott ways.\n\nRecommended\n\nOscars 2023 live updates: How to watch, nominees, presenters and more from the new champagne carpet\n\n'Scream 6' lead actor Melissa Barrera says this time around 'anyone is expendable'\n“I’m sure on ‘Foxcatcher’ I looked into the camera and went, ‘Nope, you cannot comment on what you just did because that’s not this show.’”\n\nCarell noted that the act of stealing glances at the camera was “kind of a learned strength” and applauded Amy Adams, who guest starred as handbag salesperson Katy Moore on the show, for her ability to play the camera.\n\n“You couldn’t be too savvy, especially at first,” he said. “You couldn’t play it too well. You needed to have an awareness of it without having an over-awareness of it.”\n\nThe show had a nine-season run before eventually coming to an end a decade ago. Carell’s character departed earlier, during season seven.\n\nWhile the sendoff was “a very emotional thing,” Carell said he was ready for the goodbye.\n\n“It was time for other characters to kind of step to the forefront and other storylines to be pursued,” he said. “The timing was right, I think for everybody. But simultaneously there’s just a sense of joy for me that we had experienced all of this and ... I was getting a chance to kind of take a lap with everybody,” he said.","label":[[0,8,"Time"],[10,14,"Time"],[16,23,"Time"],[38,43,"Time"],[44,46,"Relationship"],[47,59,"People"],[61,66,"Time"],[68,71,"Meaningless"],[72,78,"Place"],[80,84,"People"],[85,93,"Adverbs"],[94,99,"OtherNons"],[100,102,"Meaningless"],[103,112,"Verb"],[113,115,"Relationship"],[116,120,"Verb"],[121,124,"Meaningless"],[125,129,"Item"],[130,134,"Relationship"],[135,138,"Meaningless"],[139,142,"OtherNons"],[143,149,"OtherNons"],[150,154,"Relationship"],[166,174,"Time"],[175,179,"Item"],[180,192,"Name"],[194,198,"Relationship"],[199,201,"Numbers"],[202,207,"Time"],[208,213,"Relationship"],[214,217,"Meaningless"],[218,224,"OtherNons"],[227,233,"Relationship"],[237,247,"Acts"],[248,250,"Relationship"],[255,262,"Time"],[263,270,"OtherNons"],[271,273,"Relationship"],[279,285,"Place"],[286,292,"People"],[294,301,"OtherNons"],[303,309,"Verb"],[310,312,"Relationship"],[313,319,"Adjectives"],[329,342,"Name"],[343,346,"Relationship"],[347,360,"Name"],[362,368,"Name"],[369,377,"Verb"],[378,381,"People"],[382,391,"People"],[392,405,"Name"],[408,412,"Adverbs"],[413,421,"Adjectives"],[422,427,"OtherNons"],[432,436,"Relationship"],[439,443,"OtherNons"],[444,447,"People"],[448,452,"Verb"],[456,462,"Name"],[463,467,"Verb"],[471,483,"Name"],[484,489,"Verb"],[490,492,"Relationship"],[498,503,"Time"],[505,510,"Place"],[513,516,"Relationship"],[517,523,"Verb"],[524,528,"Adverbs"],[529,536,"Item"],[537,544,"Time"],[546,555,"Time"],[556,564,"Verb"],[565,567,"Relationship"],[568,571,"People"],[572,578,"Adjectives"],[579,587,"People"],[589,595,"Name"],[596,600,"Verb"],[601,607,"People"],[613,622,"Adverbs"],[623,627,"Verb"],[632,635,"Verb"],[636,639,"People"],[643,646,"Verb"],[647,652,"Item"],[653,657,"Relationship"],[658,663,"People"],[664,670,"Item"],[672,674,"People"],[678,680,"Verb"],[681,683,"Item"],[684,687,"Relationship"],[692,696,"Item"],[699,702,"Relationship"],[708,711,"Numbers"],[718,723,"Adverbs"],[730,732,"Item"],[743,747,"People"],[748,751,"Verb"],[754,757,"Verb"],[758,761,"People"],[762,765,"Verb"],[783,785,"People"],[786,790,"Verb"],[793,799,"Name"],[802,811,"People"],[818,823,"Adverbs"],[824,827,"Verb"],[837,842,"Relationship"],[846,854,"Adjectives"],[855,862,"OtherNons"],[867,871,"Verb"],[886,897,"Verb"],[898,902,"Adjectives"],[905,911,"Adjectives"],[912,919,"Acts"],[922,924,"Relationship"],[925,928,"Relationship"],[950,953,"People"],[954,958,"Verb"],[960,965,"Verb"],[977,981,"People"],[983,989,"Name"],[990,994,"Verb"],[995,997,"People"],[998,1003,"Adverbs"],[1004,1011,"Verb"],[1024,1027,"People"],[1028,1036,"Adjectives"],[1037,1041,"OtherNons"],[1043,1050,"Name"],[1056,1062,"Verb"],[1063,1073,"Name"],[1081,1085,"OtherNons"],[1087,1091,"Verb"],[1092,1095,"People"],[1096,1100,"Verb"],[1102,1107,"Verb"],[1108,1112,"People"],[1118,1121,"Time"],[1122,1125,"Relationship"],[1150,1156,"Item"],[1164,1169,"Verb"],[1170,1174,"Relationship"],[1175,1179,"Time"],[1183,1187,"Time"],[1193,1198,"Adjectives"],[1207,1218,"Adjectives"],[1219,1224,"OtherNons"],[1225,1232,"Acts"],[1234,1238,"Relationship"],[1239,1245,"People"],[1246,1251,"Adverbs"],[1252,1260,"Verb"],[1265,1271,"Numbers"],[1272,1276,"Item"],[1277,1279,"Relationship"],[1280,1287,"Verb"],[1288,1296,"Adverbs"],[1297,1301,"Relationship"],[1306,1312,"Item"],[1313,1319,"Relationship"],[1322,1327,"OtherNons"],[1334,1339,"OtherNons"],[1341,1344,"Relationship"],[1350,1357,"Time"],[1358,1362,"OtherNons"],[1364,1368,"People"],[1374,1383,"Adjectives"],[1387,1391,"Verb"],[1392,1394,"Relationship"],[1399,1403,"Adjectives"],[1404,1412,"OtherNons"],[1416,1417,"People"],[1423,1428,"Adverbs"],[1435,1438,"OtherNons"],[1454,1458,"Verb"],[1468,1474,"Item"],[1475,1477,"Relationship"],[1478,1482,"Adjectives"],[1483,1488,"Item"],[1491,1493,"People"],[1494,1498,"Verb"],[1501,1503,"People"],[1504,1511,"Verb"],[1515,1518,"People"],[1535,1539,"People"],[1543,1555,"Name"],[1560,1570,"Item"],[1578,1585,"Adjectives"],[1591,1593,"People"],[1594,1602,"Adverbs"],[1603,1610,"Verb"],[1615,1619,"Verb"],[1632,1645,"People"],[1646,1650,"OtherNons"],[1653,1664,"Adjectives"],[1666,1672,"Place"],[1673,1677,"Time"],[1678,1682,"Verb"],[1683,1690,"Verb"],[1699,1704,"Verb"],[1706,1714,"People"],[1716,1726,"People"],[1731,1735,"Adverbs"],[1745,1748,"Adjectives"],[1749,1758,"Item"],[1759,1765,"Item"],[1778,1782,"Adjectives"],[1783,1788,"People"],[1789,1804,"Name"],[1805,1809,"Verb"],[1828,1834,"People"],[1838,1848,"Adjectives"],[1855,1859,"Adverbs"],[1876,1877,"People"],[1878,1884,"Verb"],[1894,1900,"Item"],[1905,1909,"Verb"],[1918,1921,"People"],[1949,1953,"Adverbs"],[1954,1957,"Verb"],[1958,1965,"Relationship"],[1973,1976,"Adverbs"],[1982,1987,"OtherNons"],[1991,1997,"Name"],[1998,2003,"Verb"],[2013,2016,"Acts"],[2020,2028,"Acts"],[2029,2036,"Verb"],[2044,2050,"Item"],[2066,2073,"Adjectives"],[2074,2082,"OtherNons"],[2088,2097,"Verb"],[2098,2107,"Name"],[2113,2118,"People"],[2119,2126,"Verb"],[2130,2137,"Item"],[2138,2149,"People"],[2150,2160,"Name"],[2178,2181,"People"],[2182,2189,"OtherNons"],[2193,2197,"

{"id":2,"text":"Teacher, 31, avoids jail for having sex with pupil, 16, because ‘he wasn’t harmed’\nA teacher who had sex with her 16-year-old pupil has been spared jail because he was not ‘harmed’, the judge said.\n\nMonique Ooms, 31, preyed on the teenager while he was in a ‘vulnerable situation emotionally’ grieving a friend in the Australian town of Maffra in Victoria.\n\nThey had sex at least four times last year – in her car and at her house – but Judge John Smallwood said the boy ‘wasn’t harmed’.\n\nHe said: ‘Often in these situations the harm is what comes from other people after it becomes public.\n\n\n‘He being very close to 17 … does that go to in any way, shape or form the objective seriousness of the offending?’\n\nThe pair’s relationship started when Ooms messaged the boy on social media after noticing he was more withdrawn.\n\nThey started texting and before long Ooms was sending the teenager photos of herself in her underwear.\n\nThey kissed for the first time last July and Victoria’s Latrobe Valley County Court heard how they later discussed that it was wrong.\n\nThe next time they met they had sex in the back of Ooms’ car. They had sex here at least four times before they started arranging meet-ups at her house.\n\nSomeone sent two letters to the school principle, exposing the relationship and he alerted the police.\n\nWhen the 16-year-old was questioned by officers, he insisted he was just friends with his teacher and then warned Ooms to delete their messages.\n\nThe court heard how the pair had told each other they ‘loved and missed’ one another several times.\n\n\nAt first, Ooms denied the relationship but she ended up getting tricked into admitting it over text to a friend. When asked: ‘You did actually do it, didn’t ya?’ she responded ‘Yeah’.  \n\nOoms later pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual penetration of a child under her supervision and care. \n\nJudge Smallwood stressed the offence was not Ooms having sex with the boy, but that she had sex with a teenager she was in charge of.\n\nCrown Prosecutor Andrew Moore said: ‘There’s no definitive evidence of harm, but it is of course a notorious fact that in these sorts of cases – sexual offending against minors – harm doesn’t surface sometimes until a little bit later and sometimes decades
